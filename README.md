## Introduction

This is a hybrid Next.js + Python app that uses Next.js as the frontend and Flask as the API backend. One great use case of this is to write Next.js apps that use Python AI libraries on the backend.

## How It Works

The Python/Flask server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/vercel/examples/blob/main/python/nextjs-flask/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/:path*` to the Flask API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder. 

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:5328` port, which is where the Flask server is running.

In production, the Flask server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The Flask server will be running on [http://127.0.0.1:5328](http://127.0.0.1:5328) – feel free to change the port in `package.json` (you'll also need to update it in `next.config.js`).
